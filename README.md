- 👋 Hi, I’m @mikeburrows11
- 👀 I’m interested in nonstandard healthcare IT integration solutions.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Git and GitHub. I've been a dev for 15 years but have never had to use it.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ... nothing. I work alone. But if I have any code that's worth a damn, you can steal it.
- 📫 How to reach me ... don't.
- ⚡ Fun fact: The entire nation of Iceland has ~220 police officers.
